namespace TMS.RabbitMq.Pipeline;

/*
  The pattern represets a chain of multiple handlers to build an outgoing request middleware pipeline.
  Each of these handlers is able to perform work before and after the outgoing request. This pattern:
  Is similar to the inbound middleware pipeline in ASP.NET Core.
  Provides a mechanism to manage cross-cutting concerns around RabbitMq subscriber requests, such as:
    - error handling
    - retrying
    - logging
    - etc...
